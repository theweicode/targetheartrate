      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Who</h3>
      <p>
        I became obese before I was born. Now at the age of 36 I finally started
        to tip the scale and drive myself to a healthy weight and body.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>What</h3>
      <p>
        My mother didn’t know what good nutrition was and my brother and I were
        extremely obese before we entered grade school. Specially for me, my
        mother would top off my bottles with two cubes of sugar.
      </p>
      <h3>When</h3>
      <p>
        While this all happened 40 years ago and while there are a lot of great
        information out there for people to use to lose weight I wanted to use
        my web development ability to help others overcome obesity and live a
        healthy life.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>Why</h3>
      <p>
        My parents grew up very poor and often didn’t have enough food everyday
        to eat. So when they finally started making money they cherished it over
        the importance of looking after our nutrition. They wanted to provide me
        with everything they didn’t have, including lots of food. However they
        were not educated on nutrition and how obesity can affect you. For
        before my parents no one in my family were ever obese. Fructose sugar,
        processed foods, and drive thrus just didn’t exist back then. So when
        this all were introduced to my family we ate it up without thinking
        about the consequences.
